# pyskeleton
Skeleton Python project


## Creating a project from the skeleton

Required steps after copying the skeleton:

- [ ] Update `setup.py`
  - [ ] At a minimum need to change the "name" and "version" keys in the `metadata` dictionary.
  - [ ] Should probably replace the placeholder in the docstring with the name as well.
  - [ ] Update license.
  - [ ] Edit author/maintainer, if you're not me.
  - [ ] Add project URL if there is one.
- [ ] Update `setup.cfg`
  - [ ] Add requirements to `[options].install_requires`.
  - [ ] Add any package data to `[options.package_data]`.
  - [ ] Add package path to `[tool:pytest].testpaths` to test docstrings.
- [ ] General
  - [ ] Add `LICENSE` file.
